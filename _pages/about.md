I am a recent graduate looking for opportunities to apply my Machine Learning
and Sofware Engineering skills. My current interests are in applications of
Natural Language Processing, but I'm always excited for opportunities to learn
new technologies.

In 2022 I graduated with my M.S. in Computer Science from the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/).
As part of the [UC Davis Computational Linguistics Lab](https://compling.ucdavis.edu/) - advised by [Dr. Kenji Sagae](http://compling.ucdavis.edu/sagae/) - my research
focused on using Natural Language Processing methods to generate semantic parsers for low-resource domain-specific languages.

In 2020 I graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/).
My undergraduate research advisor was [Dr. David Feil-Seifer](https://www.cse.unr.edu/~dave/) as part of my work in the [Robotics Research Lab](https://rrl.cse.unr.edu/en/).
