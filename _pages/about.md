I am a second-year M.S. student in the [Computer Science department](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/) at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/). I am also a member of the [UC Davis Computational Linguistics Lab](https://compling.ucdavis.edu/) where I am advised by [Dr. Kenji Sagae](http://compling.ucdavis.edu/sagae/). My current research involves using Natural Language Processing methods to generate semantic parsers for low-resource domain-specific languages.

My current research interests are in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, but I've also been interested in Robotics and Human-Robot Interaction in the past. I'm really motivated to find ways to create assistive, efficient, and human-centered technology.

In 2020 I graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/). My undergraduate research advisor [Dr. David Feil-Seifer](https://www.cse.unr.edu/~dave/).
